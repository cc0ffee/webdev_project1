    <p>I love building keyboards! These are part of my collection or for clients in beautiful 1440p resolution!</p>
    <p>I theme each keyboard with a client's favorite character, season, or color!</p>

      <p>Zeal Sakurio Silent Switches</p>
      <p>This is my personal keyboard! I themed it off one of my favorite artists with her signature blue.</p>

      <p>CK Meow Switches</p>
      <p>The definition of this keyboard is pink, and it turned out really nice. The switches give a "thock" sound that is satisfying to type on.</p>

      <h2>n65</h2>

      <p>Gazzew Boba U4T Switches</p>
      <p>This client wanted the theme to be based off a character that deals with wind and clouds, so the keycap set I got was perfect for this!</p>
